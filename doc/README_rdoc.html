<p>Movement has long been used to measure time. For example, the ball clock is
a simple device which keeps track of the passing minutes by moving
ball-bearings. Each minute, a rotating arm removes a ball bearing from the
queue at the bottom, raises it to the top of the clock and deposits it on a
track leading to indicators displaying minutes, five-minutes and hours.
These indicators display the time between 1:00 and 12:59, but without
&#39;a.m.&#39; or &#39;p.m.&#39; indicators. Thus 2 balls in the minute
indicator, 6 balls in the five-minute indicator and 5 balls in the hour
indicator displays the time 5:32.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most commercially available ball clocks do not incorporate a
date indication, although this would be simple to do with the addition of
further carry and indicator tracks. However, all is not lost! As the balls
migrate through the mechanism of the clock, the order they are found in can
be used to determine the time elapsed since the clock had some specific
ordering. The length of time which can be measured is limited because the
orderings of the balls eventually begin to repeat. Your program must
compute the time before repetition, which varies according to the total
number of balls present.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Operation of the Ball <a href="Clock.html">Clock</a> -</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Every minute, the least recently used ball is removed from the queue of
balls at the bottom of the clock, elevated, then deposited on the minute
indicator track, which is able to hold four balls. When a fifth ball rolls
on to the minute indicator track, its weight causes the track to tilt. The
four balls already on the track run back down to join the queue of balls
waiting at the bottom in reverse order of their original addition to the
minutes track. The fifth ball, which caused the tilt, rolls on down to the
five-minute indicator track. This track holds eleven balls. The twelfth
ball carried over from the minutes causes the five-minute track to tilt,
returning the eleven balls to the queue, again in reverse order of their
addition. The twelfth ball rolls down to the hour indicator.</p>

<p>The hour indicator also holds eleven balls, but has one extra fixed ball
which is always present so that counting the balls in the hour indicator
will yield an hour in the range one to twelve. The twelfth ball carried
over from the five-minute indicator causes the hour indicator to tilt,
returning the eleven free balls to the queue, in reverse order, before the
twelfth ball itself also returns to the queue.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Guidelines -</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The exercise may be completed in Ruby, or JavaScript. Youâ€™re welcome to
do it in more than one of the languages.</p>

<p>No permutation or LCM algorithms are allowed.  A full simulation is
required. Please ensure that your code moves each ball.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Implementation -</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Valid numbers are in the range 27 to 127.</p>

<p>Clocks must support two modes of computation.</p>

<p>The first mode takes a single parameter specifying the number of balls and
reports the number of balls given in the input and the number of days
(24-hour periods) which elapse before the clock returns to its initial
ordering.</p>

<pre>Sample Input
30
45

Output for the Sample Input
30 balls cycle after 15 days.
45 balls cycle after 378 days.</pre>

<p>The second mode takes two parameters, the number of balls and the number of
minutes to run for.  If the number of minutes is specified, the clock must
run to the number of minutes and report the state of the tracks at that
point in a JSON format.</p>

<pre>Sample Input
30 325

Output for the Sample Input
{&quot;Min&quot;:[],&quot;FiveMin&quot;:[22,13,25,3,7],&quot;Hour&quot;:[6,12,17,4,15],&quot;Main&quot;
[11,5,26,18,2,30,19,8,24,10,29,20,16,21,28,1,23,14,27,9]}</pre>
